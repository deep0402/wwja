# README for the Worlds Worst Java Application! 
#
# WWJA is a truly awful application. Use it to leak sockets, file descritors 
# and memory or over consume CPU like no one's business. 
# 
# Typical uses of WWJA are to test the stability and resource management
# capabilities of JVMs, Java EE containers, VMs and other container technologies.
